Custom Cursor was created to allow drag and drop using a custom image cursor. I needed to drop a coin for a 3 card poker game I wanted to show the chip image being dragged. When the user left clicks on a draggable object the form shows that image being dragged and notifys the user that the image can safely be dropped. The dropped image will be displayed accordsingly.
